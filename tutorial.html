<p>Organising the study space is the first key element so make your study space neat and tidy and feel well organise because it will make less likely to lose things. Another important thing is your study table, try to have a proper study table and chair and avoid trying to study when lying down or in other situation where reading and writing is tricky also sitting posture is important while studying.</p>

<p>It is easy to get distracted while studying or attending an online class in order to focus on the subject you must avoid other things.</p>
<p><b>Stay in touch</b> with friends and family is an important thing while you are stay at home. It will make you relax and interacting with your friends can make new ideas about the assignments and other course work. Teachers are also available to contact remotely so if you require any information or if you are confused then you can ask for help. Also check your school/college website information for new updates. </p>
<p><b>Make a daily timetable</b> it is easy to mix up your study life and home life, so it is important to have a timetable for a balanced life between your school/college time and family time.  Make sure you have regular breaks, particularly a proper lunchbreak and some exercise will make you feel relaxed. </p>
<p><b>Learning style</b>, it is important to understand what learning method works best for you. For example, some people use simple question and answer format flashcards to self-test while for others more of a visual form of mind map is great at showing how the various aspects of a topic is linked.</p>

    <p>Before starting your study, session make sure you have everything you needed for the session on your study table. Make a weekly planner so you know what you are going to do this week, then mark any important dates such as assignment deadline or course work that you have to submit within a certain day, making a planner will help you to track your progress. Be kind to yourself, if you try to work for too long will just result in concentration lapses and therefore a decline in your productivity. It is important to take a short break between each study session, it is important to have a proper lunch break when you study. Studies shows that taking a lunch break allows your mind to rest, refocus and recharge which can directly increase your productivity for the rest of the day. Taking time during the day or even if you choose to have multiple, short breaks and this give your brain a chance to recuperate.</p>
    <p>Studying all the time make you feel fed up, so it is important to stay healthy and fit in the lockdown time so doing some exercise make your brain fresh. This could even be quick 10-minute yoga workout, studies show that exercise enhances learning and memory.</p>

    <p>First thing is when you are studying keep your phone away. It is tempting to check your phone on the desk. Simple presence of your phone can easily distract your mind therefore never use your phone while you are studying or researching your new assignment topic. </p>

    <p>Create a specific study plan and break can help focus on your studies. Set a break of 10 minutes after every 40 minutes of study session. When you know you have a break coming up, you will find it easier to focus on your studies. As you get used to this technique, extend the study time to 50 minutes then to 60 minutes.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Remote learning means there are lot of documents we have to store on our system, and it is easy to lost or corrupted so whenever we have a document such assignment or coursework you have to back up everything which is important for your coursework. You can back up your data to google drive, which is free up to 15GB or your school, college/university provide free Microsoft office which offers 1TB of free cloud storage so you can access the data from anywhere in the world. Also students can access Microsoft Office 365 for free.</p>

    <p>Schools, colleges/universities are depending on remote learning because of lockdown. Students are using desktop/laptop for their studies and cybercriminals are misusing this chance to attack into students or college website and accessing their data. During the periods of increased online activity, it is important to safeguard your own system and devices against online threats.</p>

    Coronavirus related Fraud</h2>
    <p>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a sharp rise in fraud both online and offline. The most common types of fraud include text message scams, phishing emails, online shopping scams and telephone scams. It is more important than ever to be vigilant against these fraudsters. Every school/college and universities main website provide details on up-to-date information about the current situation of COVID, do not use any other website or emails. It is important to make sure you do not click any hyperlinks or to reply to any emails, and to immediately delete these messages.</p>
