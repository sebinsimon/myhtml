<p>In week-1, Today I have learned the basics of HTML and which tools I need to use for my web page things like that. I learned how to create a html page using a notepad then I created a site folder which contains my main page <strong>(Learning Journal Page)</strong>, tutorial and contact page. I learned how to link my two new pages with learning journal page using "anchor" tag in the tutorial session. Anchor tag "&lt;a&gt;" is a very useful tool which is used to link one page to another not just to link a page but also we can use &lt;a&gt; to link mobile number. I have learned in depth of how to use &lt;a&gt; and using <span class="hr"> href</span> attribute specifies the URL of the page that link goes to, for example &lt;a href="ss2014.brighton.domains/index.html">Learning Journal&lt;/a&gt;is the html code for <a href="http://ss2014.brighton.domains/index.html">Learning Journal</a>. I have learned different types of HTML attributes from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp">(HTML Attributes)</a>. Also, I used an option called "Go top" which is a function a user can click on it so the page automatically goes on the top of the page, here also I used &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>

    <h2>
        <a id="week-2"></a>
        Week 2</h2>
  	<ul>
    		<li>Added posts and date</li>
    		<li>Added named anchors</li>
    		<li>Added image to my web page</li>
    		<li>Added caption below the image</li>
   </ul> 
    <p>In week-2, I learned how to use date and time with the help of <strong>"&lt;datetime&gt;"</strong> html tag. With the help of &lt;datetime&gt; tag computer system can understand the specific period of time. Another tag is &lt;p&gt; which help to give space between two different topic, it also help to style different paragraph using CSS. I used unordered lists and ordered list style, which is very helpful to list anything that contains in bullet points like the above and below points. I learned some helpful content on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp">(w3schools HTML lists)</a> which helps to understand easily because they have more examples and exercises to try. Also, I used the "id" attribute in my html, it helps to identify an &lt;anchor&gt; tag on a page. The id attribute specifies an unique id for an HTML element. The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet. On this week, I have also learned how to add an image to my web page using <strong>"&lt;img src&gt;"</strong> html tag, there are two attributes which is required to use, they are <strong>src</strong> which specifies the path to the image and <strong>alt</strong> specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. I have learned this from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">(HTML &lt;img&gt; Tag)</a>. An important thing I learned from this week is when we use "&lt;img&gt;" tag we must use "alt" tag to specifies an alternate text for the image, which helps to reach out to every users even if the image cannot displayed. Also, I have used "figcaption" tag to caption below my screenshot. Also I learned how to use email linking to the website.</p></article>

    <h2>
        <a id="week-3"></a>
        Week 3</h2>
   <ul>
            <li>I learned to use <strong>description list</strong></li>
            <li>More lists - nested and definition lists</li>
            <li>Add a table to your learning journal</li>
            <li>Quoting text</li>

   </ul>
   <div class="image_float_right">
       <img  src="images/screenshot.jpg" alt= "Screenshot">
   </div>
   <p>  In week-3, I have learned many interesting things like nested and definition lists, there are three types of list two of them which we already learned about ordered and unordered list, the third type is <strong>description list</strong> which marked up as "&lt;dl&gt;" tag line. This week I learned to create table using "&lt;table&gt;" html tag.  As shown on the image on the right side. Another attribute is about quoting something when we use journal page, we can quote a paragraph using &lt;blockquote&gt; html tag. For example below I have used &lt;blockquote&gt; tag. Another thing I learned today is how to make an image into a link. It is very useful to use an image using a link inside the web page so when we click on the image it take us to the original website of the image. Also we can use <strong>alt attribute</strong> tag to provide alternative text for any users who are unable to view the image in the browsers as I explained in week-2. With the help of w3school I learned much more about table and how to use it <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">(HTML Tables)</a>. Most important thing when we use CSS and HTML, we have to validate our page in order to identify any error so we can make change using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">(Validator)</a>.
   </p> 
   <blockquote> This is an example for &lt;blockquote&gt; html tag which is used to quote words. It is defined as a section that is quotted from another source. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quotation_elements.asp">(HTML Quotation Elements)</a>.</blockquote></article>

   <div class="image_float_right">
       <img  src="images/Screenshot1.jpg" alt= "stylesheet image">
   </div>
   <p> Week-4 I have learned important things like, CSS basics, style body elements and style other elements. CSS which control all the styling bits. We can use different types of colour using <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">(Adobe Color)</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">(w3school colour picker)</a> in the stylesheet page. "Normalize" page is a style sheet which makes broswers render all the elements using modern standards. Style sheet page directly target the elements we use in the HTML page. Stylesheet must be organised in a proper order which is important. I learned how to target a element in index.html page from stylesheet.css page by using <strong>Type selectors</strong> it need to match the name of the selector with an HTML tag eg: p{} matches &lt;p&gt;. Styling the body is important because we use &lt;body&gt; tag from the start to the end of the HTML page. In the style sheet we can use different background colour, font size, font family and font colour. This week I created a separate folder inside the <strong>public_html</strong> folder and I copy&amp;paste <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.1/normalize.css">normalize.css</a> and <a href="http://jh1033.brighton.domains/ci435/tutorials/learningJournal/stylesheet.css">stylesheet.css</a> text file into a notepad then I uploaded it into css folder inside <strong>public_html</strong>. After uploading the text file I used "link href" to link my normalize and CSS stylesheet page to my html page as shown on the image on the right side. I used "body" tag in stylesheet to use different font style, font-size, colour and line-height. Then I used &lt;h&gt; element inside stylesheet using different types of font-size, colour and line-height. With the help of css stylesheet we can easily manage to style our html page. With CSS, we can control the colour, font, font size, line height, how elements are positioned and laid out, background colours, border for images, different displays for different devices and screen sizes. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp">(CSS Styles)</a> we can use CSS in inline, internal and external. Inline CSS use style attribute inside HTML elements. Internal CSS use &lt;style&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; section. External CSS use a &lt;link&gt; element to link to an external CSS file which I used for my index.html. Example image is shown above.
   </p>
   <p>I have learned about anchor pseudo classes and its uses. Pseudo classes can be used on the link which we normally use. It is very helpful to identfiy which link we previously used, which links are not used, which link is active and when we move our mouse over the link it change the colour <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp">&#40;pseudo class w3school&#41;.</a></p>

    <h2>
        <a id="week-5"></a>
        Week 5</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I created a document with HTML5 doctype</li>
            <li>Added font-family with a fallback</li>
            <li>Added web fonts - Google fonts to my page</li>
            <li>Added style in paragraphs, text-align and margin</li>
        </ul>
   <div class="image_float_right">
       <img src="images/Screenshot2.jpg" alt= "font style">
   </div>
    <p>Week-5, I learned about the purpose of CSS and how to style the text in order to enhance the layout of the webpage as well as readability. I used CSS to style my paragraph using different fallback font for example: Fallback font means when we use two or more font and if one is not supported on user's browser then it will look for font-2, if font-2 is not supported then it will check for font-3. We can set different types of font, we can also set background colour, font colour, font size and line height, as shown on the image on the right side. In this week, I have also learned about the purpose of CSS styling and how to use it for different section in html. I also used web font (Google fonts), they have different font catalog which is easy to sort and test, it can also use in more than 135 languages <a href="https://fonts.google.com/about">(Google Fonts)</a>. In order to use google font we need to add the link from google font to the &lt;head&gt; of the webpage. Link will provide by google when we select a font style then we can use the font in CSS style sheet. It is important that we must declare &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; in our HTML documents. This declartion is not a HTML tag, it is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. Browsers such as google chrome, mozilla firefox, safari and internet explorer (Microsoft Edge) support this declaration. Older HTML documents like HTML4 or XHTML has more complicated declaration which must refer to a DTD (Documents Type Definition). <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp">(HTML Declaration)</a>. When we style a paragraph it is important to use line height, marign, text-indent and text align.</p> For example:  <pre>p  &#123; 
      font&#61;family&#58; Courier, &#34;Times New Roman&#34;, Times, Serif&#59;
      line&#45;height&#58; 1.5&#59;
      color&#58; #595959&#59;
    &#125;</pre>
      If we need to use space between blocks of text then we can use margin property. Another useful property in CSS is <em>float</em> which is used to position the image and formatting content, for example if we want a image to be on the right side of the content we have to use the following property: <pre>img  &#123;
           float&#58; right&#59;
     &#125;</pre>
      if we want to add a border or margin or to resize a image then we can use the following property:
      <pre>img     &#123;
          margin&#58; 3px
          border&#58; 1px solid &#35;000000&#59;
          max&#45;width&#58; 100&#37;&#59;
        &#125;</pre>

    <h2>
        <a id="week-6"></a>
        Week 6</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Added "viewport" in the header section</li>
          <li>Added some adjustment to HTML</li>
          <li>Added base styles and media queries</li>
          <li>Used some adjustment to image height and width</li>
      </ul>
 <p>In week-6, I have learned how to change content from left to the center and added some new html tag such as "nav" and "nav ul". Making a responive webpage is important so that every user can access it. We can use responsive layout, using a CSS3 grid template and media queries. I have used CSS style to change column/box to the left side using <em>float</em> element.</p> For example:
<pre>nav  &#123;
        float&#58; left&#59;
        width&#58; 20&#37;&#59;
        height&#58; 100px&#59;
        background&#58; &#35;ccc&#59;
        padding&#58; 20px&#59;
     &#125;
</pre>
Using "nav ul" we can style the content inside the menu. I have used following property in my CSS:
<pre>nav ul   &#123;
             list&#45;style&#45;type&#58; none&#59;
             padding&#58; 0&#59;
         &#125;
</pre>
<p>We can use wireframe to access the webpage from any devices with small, medium and wider screen size. With wireframe when we use from small device it shows in single column, if its medium screen size device then it uses two column layout and if its a wider screen size then it will use three column size. Its up to us we can use different layout like four column or five column style. In order to make my webpage more user friendly I used &lt;meta&gt; tag inside my &lt;head&gt; tag so that a mobile browser can behave like a desktop browser and display the content in full size. </p>
For example I used the following property in my index.html page
<pre>&lt;meta name&#61;&#34;viewport&#34; content&#61;&#34;width&#61;device&#45;width, initial&#45;scale&#61;1&#34;&gt;
</pre>
<p>Another CSS style is grid layout which offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, it makes easier to design a web page without having to use floats and positioning <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp">(CSS Grid)</a>. Then I used media queries, which is a CSS element which help users to view in horizontal, small, medium and wider screen devices using the <strong>display:line</strong> in the media queries. We use media queries because most users access website from mobile device and if we do not use a media query it wont display properly on small devices and some images look larger which is not a user-friendly website that is why we use media query which will automatically change the layout to the preferred size for that particular device.</p>
 Below is an example code for small screen size devices:
<pre>&#35;wrapper  &#123;
  display&#58; grid&#59;
  grid&#45;gap&#58; 20px&#59;
  grid&#45;template&#45;areas&#58;
      &#34;banner&#34;
      &#34;menu&#34;
      &#34;nav&#34;
      &#34;table&#34;
      &#34;main&#34;
      &#34;aside&#34;
      &#34;footer&#34;&#59;
  &#125;
</pre>
For medium screen size layout I have used following CSS media query:
<pre>&#64;media &#40;min&#45;width&#58; 50em&#41;  &#123;
  &#35;wrapper &#123;
    grid&#45;template&#45;columns&#58; 3fr 6fr&#59;
    grid&#45;template&#45;areas&#58;
      &#34;banner  banner&#34;
      &#34;menu  menu&#34;
      &#34;nav  table&#34;
      &#34;aside  main&#34;
      &#34;footer  footer&#34;&#59;
    &#125;
&#125;
</pre>
In order to support on a wider screen size we have to use a 3-column layout as I used on my CSS. I have used following media query in my CSS:
<pre>&#64;media  &#40;min&#45;width&#58; 60em&#41;  &#123;
  &#35;wrapper  &#123;
     grid&#45;template&#45;columns&#58; 3fr 5fr 3fr&#59;
     grid&#45;template&#45;areas&#58;
       &#34;banner banner banner&#34;
       &#34;menu menu menu&#34;
       &#34;nav table aside&#34;
       &#34;nav main aside&#34;
       &#34;footer footer footer&#34;&#59;
       &#125;
    &#125;
</pre>
It is important to make our image flexible because when we resize the browser it automatically adjust to the size of the browser. When we create a CSS stylesheet it is important to lookout for a prefect layout and it should work on different screen size. A flexbox and grid play a major role when we style them, at first it is very difficult to understand the complex of CSS but eventually we familiarise with most properties in CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">&#40;Grids layout&#41;.</a> We need to use the following element in order to make the image flexible:
<pre>img &#123; max&#45;width&#58; 100&#37;&#59; &#125;
</pre>

    <li>How to use flexible image tag</li>
    <li>How to use flexible image with text wrapping</li>
    <li>Image float and clear</li>
    </ul>
<p>In this week, I have learned how to use flexible image or called adaptive image, which respond to different viewport sizes and display resolutions. Nowadays it is important to use flexible image because most people are using mobile devices which have small screen size.</p>
    <p>The float property is used to positioning a content for example, we can use <b>float: left</b> to move the image or content to the left in a container. The float property can be used to wrap text around the image. Below is an example of float image used in CSS:</p> 
<pre>image &#123;
      float&#58; right&#59;
 &#125;
</pre>
Following is an element of flexible image&#58; <pre>&lt;img src&#61;&#34;filename.jpg&#34; class&#61;&#34;banner&#45;fluid&#34; alt&#61;&#34;description of image&#34;&#47;&gt;
</pre>
Then we have to write the followig element in the CSS:
<pre>&#46;banner&#45;fluid &#123;
  width&#58; 100&#37;&#59;
  max&#45;width&#58; 900px&#59;
  &#125;
</pre>
<p>End of this week is the last date to submit for formative assesment so we are focused on to improve the html page like, adding more content, evidence, images and changing layout.

<li>CSS3 responive layout</li>
<li>Flexbox</li>
<li>Grids</li>
<li>Floats</li>
<LI>Positioning</LI>
</ul>
<p>Today I have learned about CSS3 flexbox and multi-columns. There are four layout modes in flexbox which is, block &#40;for sections in a webpage&#41;, Inline &#40;for text&#41;, Table &#40;for two&#45;dimensional table data&#41;, and Positioned &#40;for explicit position of an element&#41;. Multi&#45;column layout allows easy definition of multiple columns of text which is like newspaper style <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_multiple_columns.asp">&#40;CSS Multi&#45;column Layout&#41;.</a> This include number of columns in a layout, as well as how content should flow from column to column, gap size between columns, and columns dividing lines along with their appearance <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns">&#40;CSS Multi&#45;column Layout&#41;.</a>  <b>Flexbox</b> is used to layout one&#45;dimensional method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill the spave and shrink to fit for smaller screen. Flex layout one is list items which is the navigation for a site. It is laid out as a row, with an equal amount of space between each items. Flex layout two is a list items which have different sizes, but we can display them on three equal size columns even if the content is small or large. In HTML we can use two elements <em>&#46;parent</em> is a div with class and it contains another div with a class of <em>&#46;child</em> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox_skills">&#40;Flexbox Layout&#41;.</a> Below is an example of parent and child div class in CSS
</p>
<pre>
 &#46;parent &#123;
 &#125;
</pre>
Below is an example of parent and child div class in HTML
<pre>&#60;div class&#61;&#34;parent&#34;&#62;
&#60;div class&#61;&#34;child&#34;&#62;Center me&#46;&#60;&#47;div&#62;

</pre>
    <p><b>CSS Grid</b> layout is a two&#45;dimensional layout system for the web. It helps to lay the content in rows and columns, and has many features to make a complex layouts. A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each row and column, it is known as gutters <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">&#40;Grids&#41;.</a> <b>Floats</b> property is commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. With float property we can use the image to float left or right to move the image to that side. <b>Positioning</b> is another property which allows to take elements out of the normal document layout and make them behave differently <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning">&#40;Positioning&#41;.</a>

</ul>
    <p>This week I have learned to create a form on my secondary page called <strong>Contact</strong>. We have to create a &lt;form&gt; element into our <strong>Contact</strong> page. It is important that we must use an <strong>id attribute</strong> to target an unique id for an HTML element. After creating &lt;form&gt; tag we have to use form elements which contain different types of object.</p> I have used the following elements:
<ul> <li>Labels: which is a text used show what option user have next to the form feature</li>
    <li>Text type inputs: text input is to enter text inside a boxes, user</li>
    <li>Radio buttons: where user can only select one option from a list</li>
    <li>Fieldset and Legend: fieldset is a box and legend is used as caption </li>

We have to use &lt;label&gt; tag to give a name then we have to create &lt;input type&gt; tag to form a box so we can enter details. On the right side is an example of my html code. Then we have to create a separate section for comment.</p> We have to use the following HTML element: 
    <pre>&lt;fieldset&gt;
      &lt;label for&#61;&#34;message&#34;&gt;Message&#58; &lt;&#47;label&gt;
      &lt;textarea id&#61;&#34;message&#34; required&gt;&lt;&#47;textarea&gt;
      &lt;&#47;fieldset&gt;
    </pre>
In the end we have to use a button to send the comment or the message to the server. To create a button we have to use the following code into our HTML page:
    <pre>&lt;input type&#61;&#34;submit&#34; value&#61;&#34;Click to send&#34; &#47;&gt;
    </pre>
